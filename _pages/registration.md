The ACL Executives are currently working on the registration fees. We hope to have registration open by June 16th

All attendees must be registered to attend the conference as one of the following.  
* Full Conference  
* Tutorial Only
* Workshop Only
<br><br>

**Authors Registration Fees** <br>
At least one author must register their paper at the Full Conference/Presenter Rate. Including Findings and Workshops papers being presented at the conference.  
All authors attending the conference must be registered for the conference no later than **3 weeks before** the conference.

**Further details:**  
* Since workshop notifications can come after early registration ends, there will be a way to add a paper to a registration.
* Authors of Findings papers who choose to present their papers at a workshop, have the option to register for workshop only or Main Conference. If your paper is presented at the workshop but you wish to attend the full conference you will need to register for the full conference.  
* D&I subsidies will continue to be available to offset registration costs and travel for those in need.
* Papers where all authors are in regions covered by the free sliding-scale virtual registration can be registered under the free/sliding-scale registration fee.

## Membership Policy
The ACL policy is that everyone attending an ACL conference must be a current (CY 2024) ACL member. So, in addition to the registration fee, each Regular Attendee will add a $100 membership fee to their registration and each Student Attendee will add a $50 membership fee to their registration if not already a 2024 paid member.  
Your ACL membership is for the entire calendar year, providing membership in the society devoted to promoting CL research throughout the world, open access to the CL and TACL Journals and ACL Anthology as well as access to other ACL conferences in the same year without paying membership again.  
Membership also entitles you to electronic notification of new issues of the journals, discounts on publications from participating publishers, announcements of ACL and related conferences, workshops, and journal calls of interest to the community.

## Cancellation Policy
* Cancellation of registration one month or more prior to the conference (July 13th, 2024, or before), will be refunded the full amount paid (Minus up to $50 processing fee).
* Cancellations up to three weeks prior to the conference (July 20th, 2024) will be refunded the ACL membership (if paid as part of the registration) and any amounts paid over and above the first $200.
* Cancellations 2 weeks prior to the conference (June 27th, 2024), and all no-shows, will not be refunded any amount. They will be able to retain the current full year ACL membership (if paid as part of the registration) and have access virtually.
* Exceptions: Cancellation due to governmental travel restrictions, failure to obtain a visa, or serious illness that prevents travel to the conference will be refunded the full amount paid (Minus up to $50 processing fee) regardless of when the notification is received by the ACL Office and must submit documentation supporting the above cancellation exceptions.

## Discounted Virtual Registration for Non-Presenters 

Discounted/sliding scale virtual registration is intended to make ACL events accessible to researchers who otherwise would be unable to participate. The application form for discounted virtual registration will be made available shortly. Criteria for selection for financial aid will include your (a) country of residence, (b) employment position, (c) monthly income range, (d) available financial support from your employer/university, and (e) special circumstances. Given prioritization for those in greatest financial need, except in the case of special circumstances this additional funding is not intended for employed individuals and funded students from USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and higher-income countries in Asia and the Middle East. Standard student registration rates (including those from these regions) are already substantially discounted.
