Dear colleagues,

<p>We hope you are doing great. We are writing this email to you because you indicated the potential interests in organizing a Birds of a Feather (BoF) session or an affinity group meeting session when registering at ACL 2024. As the Diversity & Inclusion team at the conference, we'd like to hear more from you.</p>
May you take a few minutes to fill in the [form](https://forms.gle/NaojkjBrGqJW8AeQ8). Your feedback by 23:59 (anywhere on earth time), July 31, 2024 would be highly appreciated.

<p>Let us know if there will be more we can be of assistance.</p>

Best regards,<br>
Jing, Steve, Lin, and Aparna<br>
ACL 2024 D&I Team
