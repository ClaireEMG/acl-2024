## Travel Information
### **Airports**
Bangkok has two airportsâ€”BKK and DMK are unique facilities in completely different part of towns, separated by dozens of traffic-filled kilometers, which will take you an hour (minimum) to traverse.

BKK - Suvarnabhumi Airport (31.9 km to Centara Grand Hotel)
DMK - Don Mueang International Airport (23.5 km to Centara Grand Hotel)

### **Airlines**
The vast majority of international airlines that fly to Thailand only fly to Suvarnabhumi. Don Mueang, on the other hand, is primarily served by low-cost airlines, and only by airlines that are either Thai or are based within Southeast Asia. As a general rule, if you are flying from North America, New Zealand or Europe to Thailand, you will arrive at or depart from BKK. From Australia, there is the remote possibility that you may connect through Kuala Lumpur or Singapore on a low-cost airline and arrive at DMK.

### **Parking**
Complimentary for overnight guests & Conf. Attendees

### **The BTS SkyTrain**<br>
The BTS SkyTrain runs through all important downtown districts and major transport hubs in Bangkok, from Mo Chit to On Nut (Sukhumvit Line) and National Stadium to Wongwian Yai (Silom Line). Zooming above Bangkok's traffic at a steady speed, and with connecting points to the MRT Underground, Chao Phraya Express Boats and two land transport terminals at Victory Monument and Mo Chit, it's the best way to get around.
